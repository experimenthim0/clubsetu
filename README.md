# ClubSetu — Campus Event Management System 🎓🚀

Hi! I'm **Nikhil Yadav**, a student at NIT Jalandhar. Welcome to **ClubSetu**, a full-stack web application designed to simplify how we manage and participate in campus events.

## 🧐 The Problem

As a student, I noticed that managing club events on campus was always chaotic:

- **Information Overload**: Event details were scattered across hundreds of WhatsApp groups.
- **Lost Registrations**: Google Forms were hard to track, and students often missed deadlines.
- **Manual Payments**: collecting entry fees via UPI screenshots and verifying them manually was a nightmare for club heads.
- **No Central Hub**: There was no single place to see _all_ upcoming events, causing clashes.

## 💡 The Solution

**ClubSetu** solves these problems by providing a centralized platform for everyone on campus:

- **For Students**: A single dashboard to browse all events, register with one click, pay securely, and track their participation.
- **For Club Heads**: A powerful dashboard to create events, manage registrations (with custom forms!), track payments in real-time, and download attendee lists.
- **For Administration**: A bird's-eye view of all club activities and financial transparency.
